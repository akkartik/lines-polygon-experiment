  cursor_pos == 0, previous line is a drawing -> delete drawing, cursor still visible at start of line
  cursor_pos == 0, previous line is text -> join lines, cursor still at same character

  page up moves top line on screen to bottom
  page down moves bottom line on screen to top
  cursor remains on screen
  cursor remains on text line
